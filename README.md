# Darcula (JetBrains) Theme — by Anurag Pathak

A **Darcula dark theme inspired by JetBrains IDEs** such as **IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, WebStorm, and Rider**, adapted for **VS Code**.

This theme is slightly modified to suit my personal workflow while staying close to the original JetBrains Darcula look and feel.

> ⚠️ Note: This is **Darcula (JetBrains)** — not the Dracula theme.

---

## Why this theme?

JetBrains’ Darcula theme differs slightly across IDEs (IntelliJ, GoLand, WebStorm, etc.), so an exact 1:1 replica isn’t possible.  
This theme uses a **single, consistent color system** that works well across multiple languages in VS Code.

It is optimized primarily for:
- **Golang**
- **Java**
- **C / C++**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**

---

## Language-specific notes

### Golang
For the best experience in Go:
- Enable **gopls semantic tokens**
- Enable **UI semantic highlighting** in VS Code

This significantly improves readability and token accuracy.
